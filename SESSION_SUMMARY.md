### Deliverables Created

1. **9 Specification Documents** - Complete technical specs
2. **2 Implementation Plans** - Detailed build guides (plugin + daemon)
3. **Example Vault** - Working configuration examples
4. **Repository README** - Comprehensive project documentation

---

## 📋 Session Breakdown

### Phase 1: Understanding the Vision (PRD Analysis)

**Input:** Comprehensive PRD describing Spark Assistant vision

**Key Concepts Extracted:**
- Dual interface: Command palette (atomic actions) + Chat widget (conversational)
- File-based architecture: Plugin writes markdown, daemon processes
- Mention system: `@agent`, `@file`, `/command`, `$service`, `#tag`
- Trigger automation: File changes trigger workflows (e.g., Kanban → email)
- Context awareness: Proximity-based file loading (closest files most relevant)

### Phase 2: Architecture Questions (Decision Making)

**What We Did:**
- Identified 10 critical architectural decisions
- Asked clarifying questions for each
- Got decisions from product owner
- Documented all resolved decisions

**Key Decisions Made:**

1. ✅ **Architecture:** File-based event system (plugin → files → daemon → files)
2. ✅ **Daemon:** Always-running system service (systemd/launchd)
3. ✅ **Plugin:** Two interfaces (command palette + chat widget)
4. ✅ **AI Provider:** Claude Code only (no abstraction needed)
5. ✅ **Triggers:** Inline instructions (not separate SOP files)
6. ✅ **Multiple Triggers:** Execute all matching triggers in priority order
7. ✅ **Context:** Proximity-based (current file outward, not root inward)
8. ✅ **Results:** Show ✅, minimal inline results (action IS the result)
9. ✅ **Errors:** Simple notifications + detailed log files
10. ✅ **Marketplace:** Out of scope (future vision)

**Key Clarifications:**

- **Triggers vs SOPs:** Triggers contain instructions inline (not references to separate files)
- **Context priority:** Start from current file and expand outward (concentric circles)
- **Result writing:** Most commands don't write verbose results - the action (sent email, created report) IS the result

### Phase 3: Detailed Specifications

Created 9 comprehensive spec documents:

#### Core Architecture
- **PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md** - System overview, components, file structure
- **DECISIONS_STATUS.md** - All architectural decisions with rationale

#### Technical Specs
- **MENTION_PARSER.md** - How to parse `@betty review @folder/ with $service`
- **CONFIGURATION.md** - YAML config system, trigger definitions
- **FILE_FORMATS.md** - Commands, agents, triggers file format (from PRD)
- **TRIGGER_SYSTEM_CLARIFIED.md** - How triggers work (inline instructions)
- **RESULT_AND_ERROR_HANDLING.md** - Status indicators, notifications, logs
- **PLUGIN_UI_SPEC.md** - Command palette and chat widget design

#### Supporting Docs
- **ARCHITECTURE_QUESTIONS.md** - Original questions and decisions (historical)

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning

Created detailed build plans:

#### Plugin Plan (4-6 weeks)
6 phases with code examples:
1. **Project Setup** - Obsidian plugin boilerplate
2. **Command Palette** - Notion-style autocomplete
3. **Chat Widget** - Intercom-style floating chat
4. **Notification Watcher** - Display daemon messages
5. **Polish & Settings** - UI refinement
6. **Testing & Deployment** - Production ready

#### Daemon Plan (6-8 weeks)
7 phases with code examples:
1. **File Watching** - Chokidar-based file monitoring
2. **Syntax Parsing** - Tokenize mentions and commands
3. **Context Loading** - Proximity-based file ranking
4. **Claude Integration** - API client and prompt builder
5. **Trigger System** - Automated workflow execution
6. **Result Writing** - Update files with status and results
7. **System Service** - Install as always-running daemon

Both plans include:
- Detailed task breakdowns
- TypeScript code examples
- Success criteria for each phase
- Testing strategies
- Deployment instructions

### Phase 5: Example Vault

Created working example vault structure:

```
example-vault/
├── .spark/
│   ├── config.yaml              # Main configuration
│   ├── commands/
│   │   └── summarize.md         # Example command

│   └── review-q4-finances.md    # Example task for @betty
└── README.md                    # How to use the vault
```

### Phase 6: Documentation

- Quick start guide
- Feature descriptions with examples
- Architecture diagram
- Configuration reference
- Development setup
- Troubleshooting
- Roadmap

## 🏗️ System Architecture (Quick Reference)

### File-Based Event System

```
PLUGIN (UI Only)
   ↓ writes markdown
FILE SYSTEM
   ↓ watches
DAEMON (All Intelligence)
   ↓ writes results
FILE SYSTEM
   ↓ watches
PLUGIN (Shows Notifications)
```

### Key Components

**Plugin (Obsidian):**
- Command palette (fuzzy search on `/` or `@`)
- Chat widget (Cmd+K for conversations)
- Notification display (toasts from daemon)
- NO business logic - just UI

**Daemon (Node.js):**
- File watcher (chokidar)
- Mention parser (tokenize `@`, `/`, `$`)
- Context loader (proximity-based)
- Claude API client
- Trigger executor
- Result writer

**Communication:**
- Plugin → Files (raw user input)
- Daemon → Files (status indicators ✅❌⏳, results)
- Daemon → Plugin (`.spark/notifications.jsonl`)

### Mention System

| Syntax | Resolves To | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `@name` | Agent or file | `@betty` |
| `@file.md` | Specific file | `@report.md` |
| `@folder/` | All files in folder | `@finance/Q4/` |
| `/command` | Command definition | `/summarize` |
| `$service` | MCP server | `$gmail` |
| `#tag` | Tagged files | `#urgent` |

### Context Priority

When loading context for AI:
1. **Mentioned files** (highest) - Explicitly referenced
2. **Current file** - Where command was typed
3. **Sibling files** - Same directory
4. **Parent directory** - Files one level up
5. **Nearby files** - By path distance from current file
6. **Other vault files** (lowest) - Distant files

**Key insight:** Files closest to the current file are most relevant (concentric circles from current location).

## 🚀 What's Next (For New Developer)

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Read These First:**
   - `README.md` - Project overview
   - `PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PLUGIN.md` OR `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_DAEMON.md` - Pick one to start

2. **Choose Your Path:**

   **Option A: Start with Plugin (Recommended for UI developers)**
   - Faster to see results
   - Can develop with mock data
   - Good for iterating on UX
   - Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PLUGIN.md`

   **Option B: Start with Daemon (Recommended for backend developers)**
   - Core intelligence layer
   - Can test with example vault
   - No UI dependencies
   - Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_DAEMON.md`

   **Option C: Parallel Development (Team of 2+)**
   - One person on plugin
   - One person on daemon
   - Coordinate on file formats

3. **Set Up Development Environment:**

   ```bash
   # Clone and explore
   cd spark
   ls -la
   cat README.md
   
   # Explore example vault
   cd example-vault
   ls -la .spark/
   cat .spark/config.yaml
   cat .spark/commands/summarize.md
   cat .spark/agents/betty.md
   
   # Get Claude API key
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   
   # Choose your component:
   
   # For Plugin:
   mkdir obsidian-spark
   cd obsidian-spark
   # Follow Phase 1 of IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PLUGIN.md
   
   # For Daemon:
   mkdir spark-daemon
   cd spark-daemon
   # Follow Phase 1 of IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_DAEMON.md
   ```

### Phase 1 Starting Points

#### Plugin Phase 1 (Week 1)
**Goal:** Basic plugin that loads in Obsidian

Tasks:
1. Create Obsidian plugin boilerplate
2. Setup TypeScript + esbuild
3. Basic plugin registration
4. Console logging works

**Success:** Plugin shows in Obsidian plugin list and console logs appear.

**Read:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PLUGIN.md` lines 1-150

#### Daemon Phase 1 (Week 1)
**Goal:** Daemon watches vault and logs file changes

Tasks:
1. Initialize Node.js project
2. Setup TypeScript + chokidar
3. Load `.spark/config.yaml`
4. Watch files and log changes

**Success:** Daemon starts, watches vault, logs file changes to console.

**Read:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_DAEMON.md` lines 1-200

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions (Quick Reference)

### Must-Know Decisions

1. **Plugin writes raw user input**
   - User types `@betty review @folder/`
   - Plugin writes EXACTLY that to the file
   - No transformation, no parsing
   - Daemon does ALL parsing

2. **Daemon is always-running system service**
   - Not plugin-managed
   - Starts on boot (systemd/launchd)
   - Requires installation script
   - True 24/7 automation

3. **Triggers contain instructions inline**
   - NOT references to separate SOP files
   - Instructions are given directly to Claude
   - Multiple triggers can match (all execute)

4. **Context is proximity-based from current file**
   - NOT from vault root inward
   - Start at current file, expand outward
   - Sibling files → parent → grandparent → etc.

5. **Results are minimal**
   - Most commands: Just show ✅
   - Action IS the result (email sent, file created)
   - Only write verbose results if command explicitly requests it

6. **Errors create log files**
   - Simple notification with message
   - Detailed log: `.spark/logs/error-{id}.md`
   - Notification links to log

### Gotchas to Avoid

❌ **Don't** make plugin parse mentions - daemon does this
❌ **Don't** make plugin call Claude API - daemon does this
❌ **Don't** create separate SOP files - instructions go inline in triggers
❌ **Don't** write verbose results unless requested - keep it minimal
❌ **Don't** load context from vault root inward - go outward from current file
❌ **Don't** abstract AI providers - Claude Code only for now

✅ **Do** keep plugin as pure UI
✅ **Do** let daemon handle all business logic
✅ **Do** use file system for all communication
✅ **Do** refer to specs when uncertain
✅ **Do** follow implementation plans phase by phase

## 🤔 Open Questions (None!)

All architectural questions have been resolved. Implementation can proceed without blockers.

If questions arise during implementation:
1. Check relevant spec document first
2. Check implementation plan
3. Check example vault for working config
4. If still unclear, document the question and get clarification

---

## 📝 Notes for Handoff

### What the Product Owner Cares About

1. **File-based architecture** - Everything through files, no complex IPC
2. **Minimal plugin** - UI only, no business logic
3. **Intelligent daemon** - All the smarts live here
4. **Proximity context** - Files close to current file are most relevant
5. **Trigger automation** - Kanban status changes trigger workflows
6. **Claude Code integration** - No provider abstraction needed

### What Makes This Different

Most AI assistants require complex integrations. Spark is different:
- ✅ Just markdown files
- ✅ Plugin can't crash daemon, daemon can't crash Obsidian
- ✅ Everything is inspectable (files)
- ✅ Version control friendly
- ✅ Can manually trigger by editing files

### Example User Workflow

1. User types in Obsidian: `@betty review @finance/Q4/`
2. Plugin writes that exact text to file
3. Daemon sees file change
4. Daemon parses: agent=betty, folder=finance/Q4/
5. Daemon loads betty's persona + all files in finance/Q4/
6. Daemon loads context: current file, siblings, nearby files
7. Daemon builds prompt with all context
8. Daemon calls Claude API
9. Claude responds with analysis
10. Daemon writes result to file below command
11. Daemon updates line: `✅ @betty review @finance/Q4/`
12. Daemon sends notification
13. Plugin shows toast: "✓ Review completed"
14. User sees result in their note

**All automatic. Zero clicks beyond typing the command.**
