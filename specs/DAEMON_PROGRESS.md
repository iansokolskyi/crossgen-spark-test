# Spark Daemon - Implementation Progress

**Started:** October 17, 2025  
**Target Completion:** December 2025 (6-8 weeks)

---

## Overview

The daemon is the intelligence layer of Spark. It watches files, parses syntax, loads context, calls Claude, and writes results back to files.

**Design Principles:**
- ✅ Classes over functions
- ✅ Composition over inheritance  
- ✅ Design patterns throughout
- ✅ Small, focused files
- ✅ No `any` types
- ✅ Types in `src/types/` directory

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & File Watching (Week 1)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Deliverables
- [x] Daemon project structure with TypeScript
- [x] Configuration loading system (Strategy pattern)
- [x] File watcher with debouncing (Observer pattern)
- [x] Event emitter for file changes
- [x] Basic logging infrastructure
- [x] Main entry point with graceful shutdown

### Implementation Details

**Design Patterns Used:**
- **Strategy Pattern** - Configuration loading (YAML, JSON, etc.)
- **Observer Pattern** - File watching and change notifications
- **Singleton Pattern** - Daemon instance management
- **Factory Pattern** - Creating watchers and parsers

**File Structure:**

- Resolves `@file.md` with glob search across vault
- Resolves `@folder/` paths to directories
- Resolves `/command` to `.spark/commands/*.md`
- Resolves `$service` to `.spark/integrations/*/config.yaml`
- Methods for getting all files in folder/vault

**Proximity Calculator** (src/context/ProximityCalculator.ts)
- Calculates directory-based distance between files
- Same directory = distance 0
- Each level up/down = +1 distance
- Ranks files by proximity (closest first)
- Can filter files within max distance
- Groups files by distance levels

**Context Loader** (src/context/ContextLoader.ts)
- Orchestrates all context loading
- Loads mentioned agents, files, folders
- Tracks service connections
- Loads top 10 nearby files by proximity
- Generates summaries (first 500 chars)
- Graceful error handling
- Returns structured LoadedContext

**Context Priority System:**
1. Explicitly mentioned files (priority 1.0)
2. Folder files (priority 0.9)
3. Current file (medium priority in prompt)
4. Nearby files (low priority, distance-based)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- All core classes have unit tests
- Mock external dependencies (fs, API calls)
- Test edge cases and error paths
- Minimum 80% code coverage

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end command execution
- File watching and processing
- Trigger system with real files
- Claude API integration (with mocks)

### Manual Testing
- Use example-vault for testing
- Test all commands and triggers
- Verify error scenarios
- Monitor performance with large vaults

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Class-Based Architecture
All major components are classes with clear responsibilities:
- `SparkDaemon` - Main orchestrator
- `FileWatcher` - File system monitoring
- `ConfigLoader` - Configuration management
- `MentionParser` - Syntax parsing
- `ContextLoader` - Context assembly
- `ClaudeClient` - AI integration
- `TriggerExecutor` - Automation engine

### Composition Over Inheritance
Components are composed rather than inherited:
```typescript
class SparkDaemon {
  private watcher: FileWatcher;
  private parser: MentionParser;
  private contextLoader: ContextLoader;
  private claudeClient: ClaudeClient;
  
  // Compose functionality
}
```

### No Utility Files
Instead of util files, we use classes with focused methods:
- ❌ `utils/path.ts` with random functions
- ✅ `PathResolver` class with clear responsibility

### Type Safety
- All types in `src/types/` directory
- No `any` types anywhere
- Interfaces for all public APIs
- Proper error types with discriminated unions
